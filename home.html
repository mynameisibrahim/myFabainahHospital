    <h2>The Fabainah Hospital Center</h2>
       <p>You can locate our Fabainah hospital Centre just few miles after Waterloo.
Hospitals and health systems are entering into a variety of value-based payment models with CMS and private payers. Many value-based agreements with private payers are similar to CMS' program where there are incentives for providing high-quality care that meets certain benchmarks. Others are more complex and may include accountable care organization arrangements, capitated payments for a patient over a set period of time, or bundled payments for certain medical and surgical services.</p>
   <h3>Our Hospitals is Patient-Centric</h3>
<p>A top notch hospitals truly put their patients first – in more ways than one. For example, a top hospital will make it easy for patients to search online for the information they need, whether it’s information about a doctor, information about the hospital’s services, campus maps, registration information, etc.</p>

      <h2>Openness to technology</h2>

<p>The use of technology helps in making the complicated things easy. Robotic surgeries and other advanced procedures used in healthcare systems have greatly helped in increasing the success rates for the various treatments and surgeries. Technological power should not be neglected in hospitals as they play a critical role in improving the success rate of the treatments offered. Some of the sophisticated care has been made possible and easier by use of the advanced technology in this field. Technology has greatly improved productivity and efficiency of the healthcare systems.</p>
   <h1> Environments </h1>
   <p> Environment that are healthy, safe, protective and gender-sensitive, and provide adequate resources and facilities are great contributions. </p>
   <h1>Content </h1>
   <p>That is reflected in relevant curricula and materials for the acquisition of basic skills, esp. in the areas of literacy, numeracy, and skills for life, and knowledge in such areas as gender, health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS prevention and peace. </p>
   <h1> Efficiency</h1>
   <p> 
The overall success of the whole hospital is determined by the efficiency of the various departments. The impression of your hospital will be affected when some of the staff fails in performing their duties. Your staff will contribute towards the success of your hospital when they work together. The role played by the various staff members including the support staff is very crucial in a hospital setup.
</p>
   <h1> Outcome Measures Defined</h1>
   <p>The World Health Organization defines an outcome measure as a “change in the health of an individual, group of people, or population that is attributable to an intervention or series of interventions.” Outcome measures (mortality, readmission, patient experience, etc.) are the quality and cost targets healthcare organizations are trying to improve.

Outcome measures are frequently reported to the government, commercial payers, and organizations that report on quality, such as The LeapFrog Group—a national nonprofit that evaluates and reports S.L. hospital safety and quality performance. Fabaina’s work centers on “increasing transparency among health care providers in order to reduce the estimated number of annual deaths from hospital errors, accidents, and injuries.” While initial measures focused on inpatient care, they have since expanded to include most aspects of care delivery. </p>
   <h1> Effective Communication Tips In Healthcare</h1>
   <p>Good communication facilitates the sharing of opinions, information, and feeling between different people. This is done through body languages, writing or through speaking. Effective communication is required in ensuring that information is delivered and received successfully and clearly. Effective communication between the healthcare professionals and the patients is required in any healthcare setting. Such communication is helpful in improving the patient’s satisfaction as well as providing great patient care.</p>
